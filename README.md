# Project 2 - Sentiment Trading Model

- The purpose of this project is to leverage machine learning, more specifically, natural language processing to generate a daily trade signal based on news sentiments. 
- Once a strong positive trade signal is generated, our model will put in an automatic buy trade at end of day. 
- A strong positive trade signal is referred to as a compound score.
- To ensure the effectiveness of the model, we have layered in correlation analysis between daily historical compound score to its previous closing price and generated a total correlation score for stocks that we decided to trade. 
- Our trading model has returned 30% cumulative return when back testing past 2 yearâ€™s historical data of COP (ConocoPhillips). 
- We believe by feeding in more data points and continue enhancing this model, we will make the model more effective and achieve our trading target.
